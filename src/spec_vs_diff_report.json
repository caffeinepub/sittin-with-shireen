  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive redesign inspired by sherrishowtv.com. All major requirements (REQ-10 through REQ-17) appear to be addressed with layout restructuring, component updates, styling changes, and typography adjustments. The implementation maintains brand colors (fuchsia pink and orange), preserves existing functionality (authentication, cart, video/audio playback), and keeps the green logo intact. No clear missing requirements or hallucinated features detected based on the available diff evidence.",
